# impact-uiux

This compendium of HTML and CSS documents are an update to the 2018 GHD UI, based on UX better practices for donations, human-centered interactivity and human appeal.

These files are a private project and solely for visualization and later on can be implemented in whichever server por framework configuration by injecting the HTML code in templating frameworks.

## Nüpolitan updates and modifications
In each of the rendered HTML documents you will find HTML comments that look like the example below:

```
<!-- // START Nü end of fixed nav bar // -->
<anycode>
Any content that has been modified by Nüpolitan
</anycode>
<!-- // END Nü end of fixed nav bar // -->
```

In order to process and compile the LESS styles, we are using a live app compiler 'Codekit'

## Prerequisites

You will need the following things properly installed on your computer.

* [Git](https://git-scm.com/)
* [Codekit](codekitapp.com/)

## Installation

* `git clone <repository-url>` this repository
* `cd impact-uiux`
* You can either drag and drop HTML rendered docs in browser, or open Codekit and add this directory as a project

### Deploying

It can be implemented by striping the content inside specific HTML tags and inserting your own code, variables, or templating functions.
